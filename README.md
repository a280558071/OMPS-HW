# HW of OMPS
- Homework (HW) MATLAB codes of the graduates' course "Optimization methods in Modern Power System 现代电力系统优化方法"(OMPS) at Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School(SIGS), taught by [Dr. Xinwei Shen(沈欣炜)](https://xinweishen.com/) and [Prof. Libao Shi(石立宝)](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/slb/main.htm)
- The codes are all created and owned by the graduate students at Tsinghua SIGS who attended this course at 2022 fall, from the first half semester mainly focused on traditional mathmatical programming/optimizaiton and their applications in modern power system (e. g. Linear programing/ Duality/ Convex optimization/ Economic Dispatch(ED)/ (DC) Optimal Power Flow)
- The codes are uploaded only for learning from each other's work and learning how to use Github.
- Thanks for your efforts, hope you enjoy the course as well as coding^_^.
